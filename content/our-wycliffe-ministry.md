We serve with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wycliffe.org">Wycliffe Bible Translators</a> and live in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea on a large translation center.

Andrew works as a Network Engineer maintaining the computer network infrastructure. Melody serves as a Nurse Practitioner working in the clinic.

We keep computers and bodies healthy so that the translation efforts can continue with less interruption.
