We are Andrew and Melody Campbell and we serve with Wycliffe Bible Translators in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and have been there since 2010.  Wycliffe is a mission organization whose focus is on Bible translation and getting God’s Word to those who don’t have it yet in their heart language.  Papua New Guinea is located on the eastern half of the island of New Guinea located just north of Australia. What makes Papua New Guinea unique?  There are over 800 languages spoken in PNG and 300 of those languages do not have any of God’s Word in their language.

We support Bible translation through technology and health care.   We help keep computers and people healthy so that Bible translation can continue with fewer interruptions.

We are both third-generation missionaries and feel privileged to be able to use the skills God has given each of us to serve overseas, speeding the work of Bible translation.
