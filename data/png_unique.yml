title : "What makes Papua New Guinea unique?"
content: |
  Papua New Guinea has a population of around 10 million people and is aproximately the size of California, USA. 
  <br><br> There are over <strong>800 languages</strong> spoken in PNG and <strong>300 of those languages</strong> do not have any of God’s Word in their language.
  <br><br> How different would your life be without God’s Word? If you’d never read about God’s love, His power, His mercy, His sacrifice?
