  We are Andy and Melody Campbell and our family serves with Wycliffe Bible Translators in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Wycliffe is a mission organization whose focus is on Bible translation and getting God’s Word to those who don’t have it yet in their heart language.
  <br><br>We support Bible translation through technology and health care. It’s cheesy but we like to say that we help keep computers and people healthy so that there are fewer interruptions to the work of translation.
